# supplier

Let the market and the supply chain deliver the resources and services ("products") you need, where you need them.

Supplier is a small TypeScript library that helps you build a Dependency Injection Supply Chain (DISC) for your app: a new construct that provides fully type-safe and type-inferred Dependency Injection and Context Propagation capabilities without statefulness. Think of it as Typed Containerless DI.

# The Problem

DI containers have always felt abstract, technical, almost magical in how they work. Like a black box, you often have to dig into the source code of a third-party library to understand how data flows in your own application. It feels like you lose control of your own data when you use one, and your entire app becomes dependent on the container to even work. Supplier aims to make DI cool again! The pattern has real power, even if current implementations on the open-source market hide that power under a lot of complexity.

DI was complex to achieve in OOP world because of the absence of first-class functions in OOP languages. But in modern functional languages, DI should be easier, since DI itself is a functional concept. However, TypeScript DI frameworks currently available seem to have been built by imitating how they were built in OOP languages...

The problem DI was solving in OOP world still exists in the functional world. In OOP world, DI helped inject data and services freely within deeply nested class hierarchies and architectures. In the functional world, DI achieves the same: inject data and services freely in deeply nested function calls. Deeply nested function calls naturally emerge when trying to decouple and implement SOLID principles in medium to highly complex applications. Without DI, you cannot achieve maximal decoupling. Even if in principle you can reuse a function elsewhere, the function is still bound in some way to the particular call stack in which it finds itself, simply by the fact that it can only be called from a parent function that has access to all the data and dependencies it needs.

DISCs can do everything containers do, but in a more elegant, simpler, and easier-to-reason-about manner.

<summary>A framework-agnostic React Context, usable for both Client and Server Components (Advanced)</summary>

Supplier also solves the problem of Context Propagation, so it can be used in React applications as an alternative to React Context, given a little initial refactoring. Notably, it can be used in both Client and Server components to avoid prop-drilling. Parallels can be drawn between React Context's API and Supplier's API. createContext() is handled by asResource() and asProduct() registration methods in Supplier. Context providers are modeled by the assemble()/reassemble() methods, and finally useContext() is analogous to the $() function. The only difference between the two is that $() is passed via the factory function's arguments, whereas useContext() is imported from the global scope. This means React Context implements the Service Locator pattern, whereas Supplier implements full DI. This enables the statelessness of Supplier: React Context must read its data as state stored somewhere in the global scope, whereas Supplier's products simply receive their dependencies in their function arguments.

# Features

‚òÄÔ∏è General

-   Fully typesafe and type-inferred - Full TypeScript support with compile-time circular dependency detection.
-   Fluent and expressive API - Learn in minutes, designed for both developers and AI usage.
-   Fully framework-agnostic - Complements both back-end and front-end frameworks.

üîß Dependency Injection

-   Functions only - No OOP, classes, decorators, annotations, or compiler magic.
-   Declarative, immutable, functionally pure.
-   Stateless - Dependencies are resolved via closures, not state. Some memoized state is kept for validation and optimization purposes only.
-   Auto-wired - All products are built by the Supply Chain and resolve their dependencies automatically.
-   Maximal colocation - All product dependencies (suppliers) are registered right next to the function that uses them, not at the entry point.
-   Runtime overrides - Use pack() to mock dependencies for testing.
-   Feature swapping - Use try() to "swap" a product with another of the same type, but requiring different supplies. Perfect for prototyping, feature flagging, A/B testing, etc.

üì¶ Context Propagation

-   Shared context - Assemble the context once at the entry point, access everywhere without prop-drilling.
-   Smart memoization - Dependencies injected once per assemble() context for optimal performance.
-   Context switching - Override context anywhere in the call stack using reassemble().
-   Context addition - Add new context and products depending on that new context deep in the call stack by using just-in-time suppliers.

‚ö° Waterfall Management

-   Eager loading - Use preload: true for immediate initialization of a product on entry point's assemble() call.
-   Lazy loading - Use preload: false for on-demand initialization of a product when its value is first accessed.

üß™ Testing and Mocking

-   You can mock any product using pack(), which will use the provided value directly, bypassing the product's factory.
-   For more complex mocks which would benefit from a factory, see prototype() below.

üöÄ Prototyping and A/B testing

-   Use `prototype()` to create alternative implementations of a product, that may depend on different suppliers or just-in-time suppliers than the original.
-   Prototypes' factories must return values of the same type than the original product's factory.
-   Define prototype suppliers or just-in-time suppliers to `try()` at the entry-point of your app
-   For example, you can easily try different versions of a UI component for A/B testing.

## Installation

```bash
npm install supplier
```

## Basic usage

`supplier` provides a functional take on Dependency Injection. You define your application's dependencies as `resources` (data) and `products` (services), and then `assemble` them at your application's entry point.

### 1. Create a Market

All suppliers are created from a `market`, which creates a scope shared by Resource and Product Suppliers.
You'll usually create one market per application. Markets register the names of the resources and products it `offers` so that no name conflicts occur. The name registry is the only state the market manages.

```tsx
import { createMarket } from "supplier"

const market = createMarket()
```

### 2. Define Resources

Resources represent the data and context your application needs, like configuration or user sessions. You define a `ResourceSupplier` and then `.pack()` it with a value at runtime. The value can be anything you want, even functions. Just specify its type.

```tsx
// Define a supplier for the session
const sessionSupplier = market.offer("session").asResource<{
    userId: string
}>()

const sessionResource = sessionSupplier.pack({
    userId: "some-user-id"
})

const session = sessionResource.unpack()
```

### 3. Define Products

Products are your application's services, components or features. They are factory functions that can depend on other products or resources. Dependencies are accessed via the `$` object passed to the `factory` as argument. $ is a shorthand for `supplies`, but it is just a suggestion, you can name the factory arg however you want. I like $ because it is short and will be used a lot throughout the application.

Use `$[supplier.name]` to access the resource or product stored in supplies, and `$(supplier)` as a shorthand to access the unpacked value of the product or resource directly. As a mnemonic, `$[]` looks like a box, so it accesses the packed, the "boxed", resource or product.

```tsx
const userSupplier = market.offer("user").asProduct({
    suppliers: [sessionSupplier, dbSupplier], // Depends on session and db resources.
    factory: ($) => {
        const session = $[sessionSupplier.name].unpack() //Access the session value
        const session = $(sessionSupplier) // Shorthand for the above.
        const db = $(dbSupplier)
        return db.getUser(session.userId) // query the db to retrieve the user.
    }
})
```

### 4. Define your Application

Your Application is just a `product` like the other ones. It's the main product at the top of the supply chain.

```tsx
const appSupplier = market.offer("app").asProduct({
    suppliers: [userSupplier], // Depends on User product
    factory: ($) => {
        // Access the user value. Its type will be automatically inferred from userSupplier's
        // factory's inferred return type.
        const user = $(userSupplier)
        return <h1>Hello, {user.name}! </h1>
    }
})
```

### 5. Assemble at the Entry Point

At your application's entry point, you `assemble` your main AppProduct, providing just the resources (not the products) requested recursively by the AppProduct's suppliers chain. Typescript will tell you if any resource is missing.

```tsx
const db = //...Get your db connection
const req = //...Get the current http request

// Assemble the App, providing the Session and Db resources.
// Bad syntax for demonstration purposes only. See index() below for syntactic suger.
const appProduct = appSupplier.assemble({
    [sessionSupplier.name]: sessionSupplier.pack({
            userId: req.userId
    }),
    [dbSupplier.name]: dbSupplier.pack(db)
})

const res = appProduct.unpack()
// Return or render res...
```

The flow of the assemble call is as follows: raw data is obtained, which is provided to ResourceSuppliers using pack(). Then those resources are supplied to AppSupplier's suppliers recursively, which assemble their own product, and pass them up along the supply chain until they reach AppSupplier, which assembles the final AppProduct. All this work happens in the background, no matter the complexity of your application.

To simplify the assemble() call, you should use the index() utility, which transforms an array like
`...[resource1, resource2]` into an indexed object like
`{[resource1.name]: resource1, [resource2.name]:resource2}`. I unfortunately did not find a way to merge index() with assemble() without losing assemble's type-safety, because typescript doesn't have an unordered tuple type.

```tsx
import { index } from "supplier"

const appProduct = appSupplier.assemble(
    index(
        sessionSupplier.pack({
            userId: req.userId
        }),
        dbSupplier.pack(db)
    )
)
```

### 6. Context Switching with `reassemble()`

Any product can be `reassembled` with new resources deeper in the call stack. This is useful for changing the context, like impersonating a different user. You don't need to provide all resources needed, just the ones you want to overwrite. The original resources from the `assemble()` call will be reused if not overwritten.

```tsx
const sendMoneySupplier = market.offer("send-money").asProduct({
    suppliers: [addWalletEntrySupplier, sessionSupplier],
    factory: ($) => {
        return (toUserId: string, amount: number) => {
            const addWalletEntry = $(addWalletEntrySupplier)

            addWalletEntry(-amount) // Runs in the current session's account

            const addTargetWalletEntry = $[addWalletEntrySupplier.name]
                .reassemble(index(sessionSupplier.pack({ userId: toUserId })))
                .unpack()

            addTargetWalletEntry(amount) // Runs in the receiver's account.
        }
    }
})
```

### 7. Adding new or conditional context using just-in-time suppliers

Most of the time, all context is not known at the entry point of the app. A product supplier might read user input, or a condition might narrow a resource's type. In these cases, you need just-in-time suppliers. Best example is an admin dashboard reserved to admin sessions:

```tsx
type Session = { user: User; now: Date }

// Session resource can hold any object of type Session
const sessionSupplier = market.offer("session").asResource<Session>()
const adminSessionSupplier = market
    .offer("admin-session")
    .asResource<Session & { user: User & { role: "admin" } }>()

const adminDashboardSupplier = market.offer("admin-dashboard").asProduct({
    suppliers: [adminSessionSupplier],
    factory: ($) => {
        // No runtime check needed - TypeScript ensures session.user.role === "admin"
        const session = $(adminSessionSupplier)
        return <h1>Admin Dashboard - {session.user.name}</h1>
    }
})

const AppSupplier = market.offer("app").asProduct({
    suppliers: [sessionSupplier],
    // New context computed in this factory ++ all dependent products should be in justInTime[]
    justInTime: [adminSessionSupplier, adminDashboardSupplier]
    // Factories receive just-in-time suppliers as 2nd argument
    factory: ($, $$) => {
        const role = $(sessionSupplier).user.role
        if (role === "admin") {
            //Just-in-time suppliers are not yet assmbled, you need to assemble them with the new context.
            return $$[adminDashboardSupplier].assemble(
                {
                    ...$, // Keep all previous supplies
                    ...index(
                        $$[adminSessionSupplier.name].pack({
                            ...session,
                            user: {
                                ...session.user,
                                role
                            }
                        })
                    )
                }
            )
        }

        return <h1>User Dashboard - {session.user.name}</h1>
    }
})

const session = ...//read session
const res = appSupplier.assemble(index(sessionSupplier.pack(session))).unpack()
```

## Mocking, testing and prototyping

### 1. Mocking in tests with `.pack()`

You usually use `pack()` to provide resources to `assemble()`, but you can also use `pack()` on products. This allows to provide a value for that product directly, bypassing its factory. Perfect to override a product's implementation with a mock for testing.

```tsx
const profileSupplier = market.offer("profile").asProduct({
    suppliers: [userSupplier],
    factory: () => {
        return <h1>Profile of {$(userSupplier).name}</h1>
    }
})

const userSupplier = market.offer("user").asProduct({
    suppliers: [dbSupplier, sessionSupplier],
    factory: () => {
        return $(dbSupplier).findUserById($(sessionSupplier).userId)
    }
})

//Test the profile
const profile = profileSupplier.assemble(
    index(
        //userSupplier's factory will not be called, but...
        userSupplier.pack({ name: "John Doe" })
         //assemble still requires a valid value for db and session when using pack(), since userSupplier is
         // in the supply chain...
        dbSupplier.pack(undefined),
        // if you can't pass undefined, or some mock for them, prefer using `.prototype()` and `.try()` instead.
        sessionSupplier.pack(undefined),
    )
)

profile === <h1>Profile of John Doe</h1>
```

### 2. `.prototype()` and `.try()` alternative implementations

For more complete alternative implementations, with complex dependency and context needs, you can use `.prototype()` and `.try()` instead of `.pack()` to access the whole power of your supply chain. The same example as above could be:

```tsx
const profileSupplier = market.offer("profile").asProduct({
    suppliers: [userSupplier],
    factory: () => {
        return <h1>Profile of {$(userSupplier).name}</h1>
    }
})

const userSupplier = market.offer("user").asProduct({
    suppliers: [dbSupplier, sessionSupplier],
    factory: () => {
        return $(dbSupplier).findUserById($(sessionSupplier).userId)
    }
})

const userPrototype = userSupplier.prototype({
    suppliers: []
    factory: ()=>"John Doe"
})

//You no longer need to pass some value for db and session, ince userPrototype removes them from the supply chain.
const profile = profileSupplier.try(userPrototype).assemble()

profile === <h1>Profile of John Doe</h1>
```

`.prototype()` and `.try()` can be used for testing, but also to swap implementations for sandboxing or A/B testing.
